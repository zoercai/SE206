To run this programme there are vlcj Libraries that must be referenced by the programme. These can be found at http://www.capricasoftware.co.uk/ in the downloads section. Once these libraries are installed the programme should run correctly.
When the programme is running it opens on a media player which has a menu bar at the top, a dock containing buttons at the bottom and a blank screen in the middle.
To Open a video click on media in the menu and select "Open File...". As soon as the file is open it will start playing. To pause the video press the play button, which has both pause and play functionality. To fast forward press the forward button and press rewind to go back through the video. To stop the video press the stop button. Each of these buttons have a twin in the menu bar under playback. To mute the audio press the mute button, there is a mute component in the menu under the audio menu.
To Download a video click on media in the menu and select "Download File...". You will be prompted for a URL. If the URL is not in the correct format (not a URL) the download will be cancelled. If a correct URL is entered a file saver will be open where you can choose where to save the file and choose a name. If the name chosen is the same as another in the file the option will be given to cacel, override (where the original is deleted) of continue download.  You will then be asked if the file is open source. If it is the download will begin, but if it is not then it will not download. When the download is completed a pop-up will appear confirming the download.
